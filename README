DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::ProxyCheck is a class to check HTTP proxy servers. It connects to
    given HTTP proxy servers and tries to retrieve a provided URL through
    them.

    The return message from the proxy servers can be accessed through the
    "get_answer" method.

    Whenever a check fails, you can access the reason through the
    "get_reason" method.

METHODS
  check(proxy => "$proxy", url => "$url" [, answer => "header" | "full"])
    The "check" method is used to check a HTTP proxy server. The "check"
    method includes a test to check the syntax of the provided proxy server
    address and URL. You can specify wether you want to get only the header
    or the full page as return value from the method. This specification is
    optionally. The default answer is "header".

  check_address($proxy)
    The "check_address" method is used to check for a valid proxy server
    address. When you use "check" the proxy address is checked with this
    method automatically.

  get_answer()
    Through the "get_answer" method the return message from the proxy
    servers can be accessed

  get_reason()
    When a proxy check fails, the reason can be accessed through the
    "get_reason" method.
