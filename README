DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::ProxyCheck is a class to check HTTP proxy servers. It connects to
    given HTTP proxy servers and tries to retrieve a provided URL through
    them. You can also use HTTP::ProxyCheck to check wether the syntax of a
    proxy address may be valid without connecting to a server.

    The return message from the proxy servers can be accessed through the
    "get_answer" method.

    Whenever a check fails, you can access the reason through the
    "get_reason" method.

METHODS
  check(proxy => $proxy, url => $url, answer => $type)
    The "check" method is used to check a HTTP proxy server. The "check"
    method includes a test to check the syntax of the provided proxy server
    address ("check_address") and URL. You can specify wether you want to
    get only the header ($type = "header") or the full page ($type = "full")
    as return value from the method. This specification is optionally. The
    default answer is $type = "header".

  check_address($proxy)
    The "check_address" method is used to check for a valid proxy server
    address. When you use "check" the proxy address is checked with this
    method automatically.

  get_answer()
    Through the "get_answer" method the return message from the proxy
    servers can be accessed.

  get_reason()
    When a proxy check fails, the reason can be accessed through the
    "get_reason" method.
