SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::ProxyCheck;

      # $OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH
      $| = 1;

      my $proxy = "10.0.0.1:8080";
      my $url = "http://www.perl.org/index.shtml";

      print "Trying to connect to $proxy and retrieve $url\n";

      if (ProxyCheck->check(proxy=>"$proxy", url => "$url")) {
              print "$proxy returns: ".ProxyCheck->getAnswer."\n";
      }
      else {
              print "Error (".ProxyCheck->getReason.")\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::ProxyCheck is a class to check HTTP proxy servers. It connects to
    given HTTP proxy servers and tries to retrieve a provided URL through
    them.

    The return message from the proxy servers can be accessed through the
    "getAnswer" method.

    Whenever a check fails, you can access the reason through the
    "getReason" method.

METHODS
  check( proxy => "$proxy", url => "$url" )
    The "check" method is used to check a HTTP proxy server. The "check"
    method includes a test to check the syntax of the provided proxy server
    address and URL.

  check_proxyaddress( $proxyaddress )
    The "check_proxyaddress" method is used to check for a valid proxy
    server address.

  check_proxy( proxy => "$proxy", url => "$url", dochost => "$dochost" )
    The "check_proxy" method is used to check a HTTP proxy server. In
    contrast to the "check" method "check_proxy" doesn't check the syntax of
    the provided proxy server address and URL. It also doesn't extract the
    document host from the specified URL.
